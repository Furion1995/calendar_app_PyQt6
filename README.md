# calendar_app_PyQt6
This is a little project for an calendar app./This project was made for practice with PyQt6 GUI development./The features of this app is the following:/The app needs a way to store events that we enter. The All Day checkbox should disable the time entry when checked. Selecting a day on the calendar should populate the event list with the events for that day. Selecting an event in the event list should populate the form with the event’s details. Clicking Add/Update should update the saved event details if an event was selected, or add a new event if one was not. Clicking Delete should remove the selected event. If no event is selected, Delete should be disabled. Selecting New… as a category should open a dialog allowing us to enter a new category. If we choose to enter one, it should be selected.
